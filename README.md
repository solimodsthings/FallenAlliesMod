# Overview
This is a mod for [Himeko Sutori](https://himekosutori.com/) that records the names of fallen allies. When an ally is defeated in battle, this mod writes their name, character level, and class into the in-game journal under the "Peoples" category and in a "Fallen Allies" page. If permadeath is disabled in your game, then nothing will get recorded.

This mod will save your list of fallen allies directly to your save file.
